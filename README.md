## Project Purpose:

This project will serve as an added emmersion layer in conjunction with LUNArt, our art installation hackathon project from the 
Hack Mohawk Halley Hackathon which you can [learn more about here](https://github.com/FoxtrotPerry/LUNArt).
The feature this project will bring to the art piece will be an ambient bordering lighting effect that will be able to talk to LUNArt
directly in order to mimic the background color of LUNArt in real time (Ex: During sunrise, the lighting affect will be orange, in 
dusk a fade to night time will occur, bright sunny days will be light blue, etc).

## Implementation:

This will be implemented entirely in Kotlin with a Raspberry PI driven LED strip spanning the circumference of the art installation.
